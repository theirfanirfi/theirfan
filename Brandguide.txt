Today, I build systems that **think ** — merging Software Engineering, AI Product Development, and Automation.  
From **DevOps ** to **MLOps ** to **LLMOps **, I design workflows that make intelligence *reliable, reproducible, and maintainable. *
My guiding principles:

#AIProductEngineer #MLOps #DevOps #SoftwareEngineering #Automation
markdown ⚙  **LLMOps isn’t just MLOps with bigger models — it’s MLOps with *context *. **
Traditional MLOps focuses on automating training, testing, and deployment for fixed-input models.  
LLMOps, on the other hand, manages systems that *interact dynamically * — where data flows through prompts, memory, and evolving feedback.
🔹 **Key Differences: **
1. **Data Flow: ** In MLOps, training data is static; in LLMOps, input data changes with each user interaction.  
2. **Evaluation: ** You measure accuracy in MLOps; in LLMOps, you measure *reliability and coherence. *  
3. **Deployment: ** MLOps deploys a model; LLMOps deploys an *ecosystem * — model + orchestration + monitoring + governance.
As LLMs reshape products, reproducibility becomes harder — and that’s where engineering discipline steps in.
In 2025, mastering LLMOps will separate **AI experimenters ** from **AI engineers **.
#LLMOps #MLOps #AIEngineering #AIProductDevelopment #Automation
markdown 🔍  **Most engineers master the *how *. Few master the *why *. **
Over the years, I’ve seen talented developers replicate solutions without ever asking the deeper question — *why does this work? *  
Understanding the “why” changes everything.  
It shifts us from coders to engineers.
When I began teaching programming, I noticed something powerful:  
Once a student understands *why * a loop exists, they start questioning *when * it should exist.  
That’s the moment real engineering begins.
In AI and automation, the same principle holds — clarity before complexity.
Because when you understand *why *,  
you not only build systems that work —  
you build systems that last.
